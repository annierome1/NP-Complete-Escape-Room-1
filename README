# NP-Complete Escape Room Game

This project is a web-based interactive escape room game designed to demonstrate NP-completeness and NP-hardness through Hamiltonian path puzzles. The game challenges players to navigate through a series of procedurally generated rooms—each with a unique description produced by a context-free grammar (CFG)—while a pushdown automata (PDA) tracks their moves.

## Features

- **Procedural Room Generation:**  
  Room descriptions are generated dynamically using a CFG, ensuring each playthrough offers a unique narrative experience.

- **Hamiltonian Path Puzzle:**  
  The game graph is constructed with a guaranteed Hamiltonian path (the solution path) plus additional random connections that mimic the complexity of NP-hard problems. Once a player leaves a room, its doors are locked, enforcing a one-way traversal akin to a Hamiltonian path.

- **State Management with PDA:**  
  A simple PDA tracks player moves, simulating memory management and state transitions involved in computational puzzles.

- **Win/Loss Conditions:**  
  Players must visit all rooms to win. If they become stuck with no available moves before visiting every room, they lose.

## Educational Purpose

This project is inspired by academic research in several fields:
- **Hamiltonian Path Theory & NP-Completeness:**  
  Referenced in works by Sara and Mayer & Wünch.
- **Graph Grammar-Based Puzzle Generation:**  
  Inspired by research from Zhang & Wang.
- **Pushdown Automata in Game State Management:**  
  Influenced by concepts presented by Garfinkel.

The goal is to provide a non-technical audience with an intuitive, hands-on experience of complex computational theories.
